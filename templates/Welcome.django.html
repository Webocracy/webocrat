                We're deeply connected to each other. The internet has only scratched the surface of our collective power.
                Having more people inside the decision making process makes things easier for everyone.

                Throughout history, every single time communication tools have evolved, new patterns of social organization have emerged.
                <!--<a href="#video">see video</a></br>-->
                Now, for the first time, we are able to organize in large groups at very low costs and push for the changes we want.

                Our goal is delivering the tools we all need to build social and political pressure wherever and whenever your community needs it.
                With the innovative communication and decision making system weâ€™re bringing to the table, the political scene is taking a turn.</br>

                While we all know the current system is broken almost all over the world,
                we also know that in order to get where we want we need to cooperate and integrate our vision in the

            <p>
                Real democracy is not possible without a communication system capable of handling the challenges that
                arise when millions of voices need to be heard.
                With the use of the internet and new technology this is no longer just a dream.

            <p>
                Developing an open system is key to our success.
                We believe that any public system should be open-sourced, owned and controlled by the people that use it.
                This means no hidden tricks and no meetings with closed doors.

                Being open, online communication can be easily disturbed.
                Having a button for filtering out troublemakers, spammers or evil corporate/political interests saves valuable time and energy while discouraging similar actions.

                A trust-based rating system instantly shows the real support any member of the group has.
                This means that you can give and take back the trust you gave to a person or entity. At any time.
                Just like in real life, you can choose to make this information public or keep it to yourself.

                A natural organisational model, that better reflects the relationship between people and their collective goals,
                allows us to focus on the real issues we are facing, getting the hassle of organising communication out of the way.
